__init__() is a special method which python runs automatically
whenever we create a new instance based on the class.

This method has two leading underscores and two trailing 
underscores, a convention that helps prevent Python's default
method names from conflicting with your method names. 

Think of a class as a set of instructions for how to make 
an instance.

Dot notation is used often in Python.
